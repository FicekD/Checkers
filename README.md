# Simple pygame checkers
Simple checkers in `pygame` written in a couple of hours for a friend.

**Unsupported features**
- Players cannot "jump" more than once a turn
- Rule that says that you lose your piece when you don't take an enemy piece and you could (not entirely sure if this rule is a real thing)
